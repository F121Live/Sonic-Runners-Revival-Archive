This repository is a public archive of past versions of Sonic Runners Revival


# In order to play older versions of the game you need to run a local server
You can setup your own private server by following the steps given in the Outrun repo
https://github.com/Mtbcooler/outrun

# You will need a web server to host server-side assets
There are a couple of tools for this, if you are running Windows you can set up a web server
pretty easily using "Abyss Web Server x1"
